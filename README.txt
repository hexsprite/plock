This is a Plock, a Grok-based front-end for Plone CMS using contentmirror to update content in a relational database.

Using it you can quickly deploy a purely SQL-based front-end to a Plone site quickly developed using Grok and Zope 3.

Why not Plok? Plock is a song by the band Plone.  Look it up sometime!

test.db is a SQLLite database for testing purposes.
